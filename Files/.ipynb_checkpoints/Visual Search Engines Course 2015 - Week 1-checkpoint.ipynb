    "    During this course, we will use the Python programming language  to perform image manipulation, feature extraction, and retrieval tasks.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    As a number of people have not worked with Python before, we start the course with an introduction to the language.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The Python programming language is a very popular high-level programming language with an emphasis on code readability and writing with a minimal amount of lines. The Python programming language contains a number of features that make it easy to learn. Most notably:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>It has a dynamic type system (so you don't have to explicitly give the type to a variable, like int or float or string. Python will figure it out by itself).</li>\n",
    "        <li>It has automatic memory management (so you don't have to worry THAT MUCH about freeing up data and worrying about pointers).</li>\n",
    "        <li>There is a rich set of libraries ready to import that will make your life easier (from simple math libraries to whole 2D game libraries).</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    We will in this week start with an introduction to Python and a few very useful libraries for this course. Please take care to fully understand what is happening in this introduction and feel very free to mess around with the language in order to understand how it is working. We expect that the people unfamiliar with Python will quickly come to like (love?) the language.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    There are a number of ways to create and run python programs. One way is to create a .py file (or more files) and run the file(s) from the command line. It is also possible to open a \"Python interpreter\" by simply typing \"python\" in the command line. In the interpreter, you can type individual commands, which is very useful when you want to test short code lines. For the rest of this course however, you will be using the iPython Notebook. The iPython Notebook is a bit similar to the python interpreter, but with a number of advantages. Namely, it also serves as a browser-based notebook (so we can explain the assignments AND you can write down your own notes) and you can easily print and plot results. Each week, you will be presented with a new Notebook containing some explanation as well as a number of assignments. A number of the assignments are fodder for discussion in the final report, while a few assignments are for automatic evaluation. The automatic evaluation is useful to test the code you make! For more information about the assignments and what we expect from you during this course, see the handout given at the first lab assignment.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The notebooks can be used to write and test your code for yourself and for the assignments.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <h3>Using Python in the iPython Notebook</h3>\n",
    "    Just how easy is it to run basic Python code in iPython? Simply look at the grey lines of code below this text. It shows just how easy it is to set up variables, use them, and print them.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    Simply press Shift+Enter to evaluate the code snippit below. You should get 4 lines of results, corresponding to the 4 print statements. Feel free to add other lines of code to test simple additions, subtractions, multiplications, and print statements."
